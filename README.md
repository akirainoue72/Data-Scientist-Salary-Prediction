# Data-Scientist-Salary-Prediction: Project Overview
This project predicts the salary of data scientist salaries based on various factors.
* Created a model that estimates data science salaries(RMSE~$11k) that can help data scientists predict their salaries for incoming jobs. 
* Feature engineered the data to quantify the value that companies and different types of positions put on certain coding languages(python,SQL,etc)
* Used Linear Regression, Lasso, Regression, and Random Forest Regressors and optimized them using GridSearchCV
